GETTING STARTED
Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Network (SSM-NET)
Version: 2.1
Date: November 10, 2025
Caution: Research/observation only. Not for critical decision-making.

Goal
Emit and verify SSM-NET declarations without changing existing payloads.
Day-1: Attach declarations.
Day-7: Publish what you promise.
Day-30: Enforce and verify.

Prerequisites

Attachment point. A place to carry small metadata beside payloads (headers, trailer, sidecar, or message metadata).

UTC clock for stamp.

A published manifest_id defining:

bands and cutpoints

boundary inclusivity

timing windows

alignment pipeline parameters (eps_a, eps_w, weight rule w)

canonical subset recipe

Day-1 — Emit Minimal Declarations (Label-First)

Sender MUST

Preserve payload (phi((m,a)) = m).

Attach the following fields (names illustrative):

ssmnet-band: <label>
ssmnet-manifest: <manifest_id>
ssmnet-commit: sha256=<hex>
ssmnet-stamp: SSMCLOCK1|<iso_utc>|nonce=<...>|sha256=<...>|prev=<...>
ssmnet-align: <value in -1..+1>   // only if required by the manifest


Compute canonical subset commitment, for example:

bytes := JOIN_WITH_NEWLINES([
    headerA,
    headerB,
    byte_range(payload, i:j)
])
sha256 := SHA256(bytes)


Receiver SHOULD

Recompute SHA256(canonical_subset) and match ssmnet-commit.

Map align → band using the manifest (or verify provided band).

Record the declaration envelope for replay.

Day-7 — Publish What You Promise

Publish the manifest and canonical subset recipe.

Host a policy shelf containing versioned manifests.

Begin applying the acceptance checklist on inbound traffic:

align is bounded (if present).

sha256 matches canonical subset commitment.

band is correct under the manifest cutpoints.

prev chain continuity is consistent.

Disclosure mode matches the manifest.

Day-30 — Enforce and Verify

Apply timing windows and actions based on band.

Append intermediary observation stamps when meaningful handling occurs (append-only; never rewrite).

Store evidence bundles:

envelopes.jsonl
hashes.txt
checkpoint.txt
verify.sh


Verification script checks:

canonical subset bytes

hash commitments

band mapping

prev continuity

outputs ALL CHECKS PASSED or a structured failure reason

Reference Snippets

Alignment Pipeline (Deterministic & Bounded)

a_c := clamp(a_raw, -1+eps_a, +1-eps_a)
u   := atanh(a_c)
U  += w*u ; W += w
align := tanh(U / max(W, eps_w))


Tolerance note: eps_a > 0 and eps_w > 0 prevent edge pathologies (e.g., atanh(±1), divide-by-zero). 
Choose display precision appropriate to your serializer; verification binds bytes of the canonical subset, not pretty-printed numbers.

Continuity Stamp (Example Shape)

SSMCLOCK1|2025-11-10T10:02:11Z|nonce=9f3a..|sha256=7c4b..|prev=5a1e..


Minimal Envelope (Illustrative)

{
  "band": "A0",
  "manifest_id": "TRANSPORT_POSTURE.DEMO",
  "sha256": "7c4b...e1",
  "stamp": "SSMCLOCK1|2025-11-10T10:02:11Z|nonce=9f3a..|sha256=7c4b..|prev=5a1e.."
}


Troubleshooting

Condition	Treatment
sha256 mismatch	Quarantine declaration; preserve payload.
align out of bounds	Treat lane as invalid; fallback to label-first or review.
Unknown manifest_id	Hold until manifest is fetched.
Broken chain (prev)	Accept payload, mark declaration non-evidential.

Wire Format Guidance

Use ASCII for keys.

Maintain case-exact values.

When needed, canonical subset bytes must be byte-accurate, not pretty-printed.

Security & Clock Hygiene

stamp is tamper-evident, not a substitute for channel authentication.

Default UTC skew tolerance: ±120 seconds (tunable via manifest).

For sensitive disclosures over HTTP-like transports, SHOULD use a secure channel.

Versioning

Increment manifest_id when cutpoints or disclosure rules change.

Keep canonical subset recipe stable across minor revisions.

If the canonical subset changes → rotate manifest.

Testing Loop

Generate declaration.

Paste and verify (expect ALL CHECKS PASSED).

Save evidence bundle.

Run verify.sh.

Fetch checkpoint and compare against current head.

One-Line Takeaway
The payload never changes.
The meaning becomes verifiable.
